  New:
    * Added zhTW translation (big thanks to wushiny)
    * Added Cataclysm raid zone names and boss IDs
    * Added option to use a trigger for the guild attendance check instead of the character name
    * Added basic chat filtering. MRT will now supress any whispers, which are handled by the guild attendance check. MRT will print a status message, when anyone added someone as a boss attendee. This should reduce whisper spam and make MRT compatible with WIM.
    * Added UI button for starting a guild attendance check. (Same effect as '/mrt dkpcheck')
    * Added new slash command '/mrt deleteall now' for deleting the raid log. (Use with caution - there is no extra "Are you sure?"-dialog)

    * Raid zone translations are now handled by LibBabble-Zone-3.0 - they shouldn't need a manual translation anymore.

    * EQdkp-Plus XML is now the default export format
    * The player information of the EQdkp-Plus XML export is now sorted by player name
    * EQdkp-Plus XML Export and CTRT-Export: When exporting a single boss, MRT will now set the timestamp of the previous boss (if not available, then the raid start) as raid start.
    * Revamped functions for recovering a tracked raid after a relog or normal disconnect. It should be now more fault tolerant regarding lags.

    * Updated frFR translation and boss yells (thanks to Cindelle and deepking)
    * Updated koKR translation (thanks to 7destiny)
  Bug Fixes:

  Changes:
    * MRT now supports data exports of a running raid.
  Bug Fixes:
    * Fixed a lua-error which occured at the very last part of the Lich King fight. Because of that, the kill detection for the Iron Council (Stellbraker last) is deactivated once again, because both bosses use the same emote. This will be fixed in the next release. Hopefully. (Ticket ID 13)
    * Fixed an issue with the CTRT-Export, which produced a wrong time format on Mac system. (Ticket ID 6)

0.21 Beta - Changelog:
  New:
    * Added support and a complete UI translation for spanish (esES) clients (a big thanks to Hestrall, who translated 90% of the addon).
      (Note: Boss yells for Halion, Horde Gunship Battle, TotC bosses and Ulduar bosses are still missing. For specific boss support, see the translation status page at CurseForge.com).

    * Added regularly check for PlayerDB and delete unused entries.
    * Added a LibDataBroker data source for opening the raidlog and the options panel
  Changes:
    * 'Add Bosskill' dialog: Deleted the user dialog, which asked, if raid attendees should be copied to the boss attendees list. This is now done by default. Since raid attendee data takes priority over boss attendee data since v0.17, having this optional didn't make sense anymore.
    * Updated deDE translation.
  Bug Fixes: 
    * Changed layout of the boss kill table slightly. The last column shouldn't cut off anymore.

0.17 Beta - Changelog:
  New:
    * Added option for disabling boss based attendee data for CTRT-export (if you only create one raid entry for each raid in your EQDKP(-Plus) and make corrections to raid members manually, you might want to activate this option)
    * Added checks to prevent exporting of an active raid (raid data is incomplete until a raid is finished)
    * Added option for disabling the confirmation box for an attendance check.
  Changes:
    * Rewritten large parts of the CTRT-Export. Raid attendee data now take priority over boss attendee data. This should fix the Join/Leave timestamps and provide correct information for time based DKP systems (Thanks to Omega for pointing that out)
    * Disconnecting players are now treated as leaving players, if "Track offline players" is disabled.
    * In 10/25 raids, players moved in groups >2/>5 are now treated as leaving players, if "Track only first 2/5 groups" is enabled.

    * The RaidLog browser will now show raid loot, if a raid event but no boss event is selected (the title of the table will change accordingly).
    * Changed localization files for supporting the CurseForge localization system.
  Bug Fixes:
    * Fixed boss detection of the horde gunship battle (ICC - untested)
    

0.15 Beta - Changelog:
  New:
    * Added two new export formats: plain text and BBCode formatted text (choose your export format in the options panel)
    * Added new option panel for export options
    * CTRT-Export: Added option for automatically adding one item of poor item quality to each boss at data export. This should fix a bug in the EQDKP-CTRT-Import-Plugin boss detection. Boss detection fails, if no loot is connected to a boss event (i.e. attendance checks).
