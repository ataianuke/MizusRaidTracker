	<li>Added Cataclysm raid zone names and boss IDs</li>
	<li>Added option to use a trigger for the guild attendance check instead of the character name</li>
	<li>Added basic chat filtering. MRT will now supress any whispers, which are handled by the guild attendance check. MRT will print a status message, when anyone added someone as a boss attendee. This should reduce whisper spam and make MRT compatible with WIM.</li>
	<li>Added UI button for starting a guild attendance check. (Same effect as '/mrt dkpcheck')</li>
	<li>Added new slash command '/mrt deleteall now' for deleting the raid log. (Use with caution - there is no extra "Are you sure?"-dialog)</li>

</ul>
<strong>Changes:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The tracking options panel were split up into two new panels ('Raid tracking' and 'Item tracking')</li>
	<li>Rewritten the CTRT-compatible export once again. It should be a bit faster. (but not by much)</li>
	<li>Renamed CTRT-compatible export to "EQdkp / MLdkp 1.1 (CTRT compatible)"</li>
	<li>Raid zone translations are now handled by LibBabble-Zone-3.0 - they shouldn't need a manual translation anymore.</li>
	<li>Enhanced boss ID based kill detection: Boss events with multiple mobs and a shared health pool are now trackable with a boss ID. An automatic rename system have been implemented in order to provide correct naming for such boss events (e.g. Prince Keleseth -&gt; Blood Prince Council)</li>

	<li>EQdkp-Plus XML is now the default export format</li>

	<li>Revamped functions for recovering a tracked raid after a relog or normal disconnect. It should be now more fault tolerant regarding lags.</li>
